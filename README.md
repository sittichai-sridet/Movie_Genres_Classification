# Movie_Genres_Classification
## Objective
This work is my Project in Deep Learning class of BADS program at NIDA.
 In this project will load information from the website (https://www.imdb.com/) and is about the classification of posters from the IMDb website. To come up with a model for remembering the first type of movie poster. To learn and understand the process of modeling and how to create appropriate models.

The given problem is similar to many projects on Kaggle, but it involves refactoring the dataset and creating a model for the new data.
